## Business Questions
- Total KPI Tracking: Total revenue, quantity sold, profit, and total unique customers
- Monthly Trend Analysis for each of these KPIs: Can you find any seasonal trends or patterns in the sales data?
- Month Over Month Comparisonn
- Product Performance Evaluation: Which product categories drive the biggest profits? 

## Analysis Findings and Recommendations
- The trend in the monthly/yearly revenue shows that has been a consistenet decline in sales in the month of August, it is pertinent that the marketing department should investigate the cause of this nose diving
trend in the sales recorded during such time, and different campaign strategies should be put in place to mitigate this issue.
- The RT Revenue chart shows that over the month, there has been a consistent improvement in the revenue generated in both years which indicates that the sales made is quite encouraging
- The product category chart shows that Products in the Toys categories are generating the highest number of sales followed by electronics, the difference between the revenue generated by the two categories are not much and it will be good if the management can look into reinforcing having more of these products in stock. While the other products can also be looked into to study why the sales of such are not moving in the same pace with others
